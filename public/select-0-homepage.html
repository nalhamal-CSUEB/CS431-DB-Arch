	<h1>Home page </h1>
	<h2>Display Table Contents </h2>
	<p>Select a table from the left panel of options. The contents of the entire table will be displayed. <br>
		The table headings have arrow buttons that will resend the query and change the order the data is displayed (order by).
	</p>
	
	<p>There is an update feature. On the right hand side of any table, there is a column that is currently empty. If you click there,
		you will get an option to update the table or cancel. The buttons "Update" and "Cancel" are visible at that time.
	</p>
	
	<p>The last feature I was able to implement is an insert button. Unfortunately, this isn't very dynamic, as it doesn't give the User
		options to select from a drop down menu, or to leave values empty and allow for autoincrement to be completed by the database.
	</p>
	
	<p>This project was completed using mysql Workbench and mysql database. NodeJS and packages Express, mysql2, and path.
	</p>
	
	<p>With more time, I would have liked to implement join statements and built additional sections with reports.
	</p>
	
	<p>I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp"> W3Schools-nodejs </a> to get familiar with NodeJS, <br>
		<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html"> NodeJS.org </a> for the NodeJS documentation,<br>
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> W3Schools-html </a> to get familiar and practice HTML, <br>
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"> W3Schools-JS </a> to get familiar and practice JavaScript, <br>
		<a href="https://expressjs.com/"> ExpressJS.com </a> to get familiar with this application to simplify this web application, <br>
		and I built the database in Mysql workbench using model tool to generate tables with columns and relating them to one another.
		The style_sheet came from a project I worked on years ago, and so I just used it to save some time.
	</p>
	
	<p> On many occasions, I was stuck and sought information on the web. Stackoverflow, 
		<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-express-basics"> Digital Ocean </a>, and 
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction"> 
		Mozilla Developer </a>
		were very helpful. I also used openAI to help me add understand and add the insert functionality in the webpage. I still have more to 
		learn and understand as I didn't yet venture into writing join queries.
